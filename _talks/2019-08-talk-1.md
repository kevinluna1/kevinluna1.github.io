In this talk I will present progress toward understanding the role that the numerous fluctuating dissipative fluxes that occur in chemically reacting mixtures play in the kinetic fluctuations boundary layer receptivity problem. These fluctuations are modeled using fluctuating hydrodynamics where the molecular nature of fluids is expressed through stochastic white noise contributions to the dissipative fluxes.
